# Bootstrap-Project

In this application I have created a one page scrollable responsive website using bootstrap 3.
It has various tabs like the feedback, Gallery, Features, FAQ and ContactUS. When we click on a particular tab it scrolls to that particular section and also the images are made to slideshow using the carousel plugin in bootstrap. 
Each tab is also made to highlight when we scroll through that particular section.
